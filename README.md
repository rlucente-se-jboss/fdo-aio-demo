# fdo-aio-demo
This demonstrates FIDO Device Onboarding (FDO) using the FDO
all-in-one packages on RHEL 8/9. This demonstration will build an
ISO installer for an edge device and then leverage the FDO protocol
to provision the device with the [How's My Salute](https://github.com/tedbrunell/HowsMySalute)
application and a timer and service to periodically check for and
apply any application updates. After FDO provisioning, the edge
device will run the application in kiosk mode. You'll need an
external USB webcam and monitor for this demonstration.

## Install a RHEL instance for the FDO server
Start with a minimal install of RHEL 8 or 9. Make sure this repository
is copied to your RHEL host. You'll run an FDO server and an edge
device. These can be either virtual or physical machines. If running
virtual machines on the same host for this demo, please ensure that
there are adequate resources for them. My personal laptop has 32
GB of memory and 8 cores (16 hyperthreads) so I allocate the following
to the guest VMs:

* RHEL guest for image-builder, registry, and FDO server: 10 GB, 6 vCPUs
* Edge RHEL guest: 6 GB, 2 vCPUs

The two guest VMs above will collectively consume half the resources
for my laptop.

Both the FDO server and the edge device need to communicate with
one another. Only the FDO server needs outside connectivity. How
you do this depends on your physical or virtualization solution.
For guest VMs, I use VirtualBox on my OSX laptop so I configure
networking like so:

* RHEL guest for FDO server: one NAT interface and one host-only interface
* Edge RHEL guest: one host-only interface

During the FDO server RHEL installation, configure a regular user
with `sudo` privileges.

### Adjust demo settings
These instructions assume that the `fdo-aio-demo` git repository
is copied to your own home directory on your FDO server instance.

You'll need to customize the settings in the `demo.conf` script to
include your Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM) credentials to
login to the [customer support portal](https://access.redhat.com)
to pull updated content. The `FDO_SERVER` setting should be an
address that the edge device will use to communicate with the FDO
server. On my laptop, this is the IP address assigned to the host-only
network interface on the FDO server. The `EDGE_USER`, `EDGE_PASS`,
and `EDGE_STORAGE_DEV` parameters define the login information for
the virtual edge device as well as the base storage device. The
default storage device is correct for VirtualBox but may be different
for another solution. My VirtualBox host-only DHCP server is
configured to give a predictable IP address to the FDO server. Make
sure to do something similar for your environment and/or adjust the
`FDO_SERVER` setting in the `demo.conf` file.

## Configure the FDO server
The shell scripts included in this repository handle setting up all
the dependencies to support the demo. To begin, go to the directory
hosting this repository.

    cd ~/fdo-aio-demo

The first script registers with the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com)
using the credentials provided in the `demo.conf` file. All packages
are updated. It's a good idea to reboot after as the kernel may
have been updated.

    sudo ./01-setup-rhel.sh
    reboot

The second script installs several packages including the rpm-ostree
image builder as well as enabling the web console with the image
builder plugin. The web console can be accessed via the
https://YOUR-FDO-SERVER-IP-ADDR-OR-NAME:9090 URL where
YOUR-FDO-SERVER-IP-ADDR-OR-NAME matches the DNS name or IP address
of your FDO server. The current user is added to the `weldr` group
to support use of image builder within the web console. Please make
sure to log out and then log in again to update the group memberships
for your session.

    cd ~/fdo-aio-demo
    sudo ./02-install-image-builder.sh
    exit

The third script configures a docker v2 registry to enable edge
devices to pull container images without requiring external network
access.  Once this demo is installed, I can easily run it using the
host-only network features of virtualbox without external connectivity.

    sudo ./03-config-registry.sh

Test that the container registry is up and running using the following
command:

    curl -s http://YOUR-FDO-SERVER-IP-ADDR-OR-NAME:5000/v2/_catalog | jq

where YOUR-FDO-SERVER-IP-ADDR-OR-NAME matches the DNS name or IP
address of your FDO server.

The fourth script generates the blueprint files needed to create
the rpm-ostree image and then later package it as an ISO installer.

    ./04-prep-image-build.sh

The fifth script builds the [How's My Salute](https://github.com/tedbrunell/HowsMySalute)
demo as a containerized application. The US Army version is tagged as
`prod` with the intent of moving that tag from one version to another
to trigger application updates on the edge device. This is discussed
later.

    sudo ./05-build-containers.sh

Verify that the application is in the registry using the following
command:

    curl -s http://YOUR-FDO-SERVER-IP-ADDR-OR-NAME:5000/v2/_catalog | jq

where YOUR-FDO-SERVER-IP-ADDR-OR-NAME matches the DNS name or IP
address of your FDO server.

If you need to rebuild the container web applications, run the
following commands to clear out the current images and remove the
local HowsMySalute folder:

    REPOID=YOUR-FDO-SERVER-IP-ADDR-OR-NAME:5000/howsmysalute
    sudo podman rmi -f $REPOID:army
    sudo podman rmi -f $REPOID:navy
    sudo podman rmi -f $REPOID:usaf
    sudo podman rmi -f $REPOID:usmc
    sudo podman rmi -f $REPOID:prod
    sudo rm -fr HowsMySalute
    sudo ./05-build-containers.sh

where YOUR-FDO-SERVER-IP-ADDR-OR-NAME matches the DNS name or IP
address of your FDO server.

The sixth and final script installs and configures the FDO all-in-one
service. To configure the edge device, the script relies on the
files in the `device0` folder as well as the
`serviceinfo_api_server.yml.template` file for the installation
commands.

NB: Generating the systemd service file for the application requires
creating a container. The container creation will fail if no webcam
device is attached to the FDO server. Make sure when running this
script that a webcam is attached and the `/dev/video0` device exists.

Run the script to install and configure the FDO all-in-one components
and setup the edge device FDO configuration files.

    sudo ./06-install-fdo-aio.sh

After the script is run, you can review the content of the files
used to configure the edge device.

    find /etc/device0/cfg -type f -print -exec cat {} \; | less
    less /etc/fdo/aio/configs/serviceinfo_api_server.yml

At this point, the needed software components have been installed
to support the demo.

## Create the rpm-ostree image
Now, we'll use the instructions in the `edge-blueprint` file to
create the rpm-ostree image for the edge device. The rpm-ostree
image will be packaged within an OCI container with an associated
web application so that we can easily serve the content to the next
stage in the build to create the ISO installer. Let's first push
the blueprint to the image builder and then start the compose.

    composer-cli blueprints push edge-blueprint.toml
    composer-cli compose start-ostree Edge edge-container

On my laptop, the compose takes about six minutes to complete but
your mileage may vary. You can watch the status of the submitted
job using:

    watch composer-cli compose status

When the status is `FINISHED`, use CTRL-C to stop the above command.

## Build the ISO installer image
Next, we'll download the rpm-ostree image packaged inside an OCI
container and then run the container application to support the
creation of the ISO installer.

If there are multiple rpm-ostree image on your host, use the
following command to identify the correct one.

    composer-cli compose status

On my system, the output looks like the following where the UUID
is the first column:

    $ composer-cli compose status
    c11e41be-b6f0-4813-8eb4-a6094de1eb86 FINISHED Thu Jul 7 19:15:40 2022 Edge            0.0.1 edge-container

If there's only one rpm-ostree image, you can simply hit tab on the
following command to autofill the UUID of the image to download.

    composer-cli compose image <TAB>

We'll copy the compressed OCI container to our local container
storage and then run the container to provide rpm-ostree content
to support the creation of the ISO installer.

    skopeo copy oci-archive:<UUID>-container.tar containers-storage:localhost/rfe-mirror:latest
    podman run --rm -p 8000:8080 rfe-mirror

Once the container is running, in a separate terminal window go
ahead and kickoff the ISO installer build. The build will use the
simplified installer to create the ISO installer. The simplified
installer will simply copy content directly to the edge device
storage device without the need for a kickstart file.

To start the build, push the blueprint to the image builder service
and then launch the compose as shown below.

    composer-cli blueprints push simplified-installer.toml
    composer-cli compose start-ostree SimplifiedInstall edge-simplified-installer \
                 --url http://YOUR-FDO-SERVER-IP-ADDR-OR-NAME:8000/repo/

The compose for the ISO installer takes around four minutes on my
laptop. Again, your mileage may vary. You can monitor the build
using the command:

    watch composer-cli compose status

When the status is `FINISHED`, use CTRL-C to stop the above command.
In the other terminal window, use CTRL-C to stop the podman instance.

## Download the ISO installer
Identify the ISO installer image using the command:

    composer-cli compose status

On my system, the output looks like the following where the UUID
is the first column:

    $ composer-cli compose status
    c11e41be-b6f0-4813-8eb4-a6094de1eb86 FINISHED Thu Jul 7 19:15:40 2022 Edge            0.0.1 edge-container
    580f7278-2e06-43c2-bd4f-2957d66df0d6 FINISHED Thu Jul 7 19:27:10 2022 SimplifiedInstall 0.0.1 edge-simplified-installer 10737418240

Download the ISO installer using the command:

    composer-cli compose image <INSTALLER-UUID>

The ISO can now be used to install an edge device. I subsequently
downloaded this ISO file from the RHEL host VM to my laptop so I
could use it to install a second VM for the edge device. If working
with a physical edge device, put the ISO file onto a USB thumb
drive. There are ample instructions and tools available on how to
do that.

## Demonstrate FIDO Device Onboarding (FDO)
The process and steps necessary for FDO are explained in the
[Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/composing_installing_and_managing_rhel_for_edge_images/assembly_automatically-provisioning-and-onboarding-rhel-for-edge-devices_composing-installing-managing-rhel-for-edge-images#doc-wrapper).
The above setup has reached step 9 in
[7.2. Automatically provisioning and onboarding RHEL for Edge devices](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/composing_installing_and_managing_rhel_for_edge_images/assembly_automatically-provisioning-and-onboarding-rhel-for-edge-devices_composing-installing-managing-rhel-for-edge-images#con_automatically-provisioning-and-onboarding-rhel-for-edge-devices_assembly_automatically-provisioning-and-onboarding-rhel-for-edge-devices)
of the FDO process description.

### Monitor the server processes
It's helpful to watch the activity of the various FDO services
during device initialization and then onboarding. Open a terminal
window to your FDO server and type the following commands:

    cd /etc/fdo/aio/logs
    sudo truncate -s 0 *.log
    watch ls -lat

You'll now be monitoring the logs of the various FDO services and
you'll be able to see when they are updated during the process.

### Create and boot a virtual edge device
You'll need to create and boot a virtual or a physical edge device
that has network connectivity to your FDO server. I create a virtual
edge device using VirtualBox on my Mac laptop for this and there's
too much to describe here on how to create and launch a virtual
machine. For this demo, the edge device (physical or virtual) must
meet the following criteria:

* Available network connectivity between the FDO server and the edge device
* Ability to monitor the edge device during installation and reboot (a virtual console or monitor for physical device)
* The ISO installer is accessible to the edge device (e.g. a bootable virtual CD/DVD or a physical USB thumb drive)

The above conditions are invaluable to determine where a problem
lies if the edge device does not provision.

### Observe the FDO process during edge device initial boot
When the edge device is first booted, the simplified ISO installer
will copy the rpm-ostree image contents directly to the edge device
storage. No kickstart file is used by the simplified installer. A
short handshake will occur between the edge device and the manufacturing
server to perform the initial device credential exchange. The edge
device will then power off. The manufacturing server, onboarding
server, and rendezvous server will also have credentials set to
support provisioning the device when it is rebooted.

The FDO onboarding process supports "late binding" where the edge
device can be given just enough configuration at time of manufacture
to support full on-boarding once it arrives at its intended
destination. It's not necessary to fully provision the device all
at once and the provisioning instructions can be changed between
the time of manufacture and the first time the edge device boots
in the field, giving a lot of flexibility to the eventual device
owner. FDO also supports, via the use of certs and keys, the ability
to do Device Initialization over Untrusted Networks (DIUN). This
demo does not show DIUN.

### Boot and provision the edge device
Modify the edge device to remove the ISO installer. On VirtualBox,
I simply remove the file from the virtual CD/DVD. Take whatever
action is appropriate for your scenario. For a physical device, you
would simply remove the USB thumb drive.

Next, if the `watch` command from above is still running on the FDO
server, terminate it using CTRL-C and then truncate the logs and
restart monitoring on the FDO server using the commands:

    cd /etc/fdo/aio/logs
    sudo truncate -s 0 *.log
    watch ls -lat

Continue to monitor the various FDO service logs while starting the
edge device. The changes will occur quickly but what you should see
is that the edge device contacts the rendezvous server to determine
it's owner, the device and owner use shared credentials to authenticate
to one another and then the owner uses the serviceinfo API server
to provision the edge device. If this all works correctly, you'll
see a container application start on the edge device in its console.
The edge device is provisioned to run the GNOME desktop and firefox
browser in "kiosk" mode where no user interaction is permitted to
change configuration or run alternative applications.

### Demonstrate podman auto-update
There are actually two versions of the container web application
that can run on the edge device. Both versions reside in the local
container registry running on the FDO server. This is an additional
capability to support this demo beyond the requirements for FDO
provisioning. The edge device has a slightly modified podman-auto-update
systemd service that checks the container registry every thirty
seconds and then, if the container image tagged as "prod" is different
than what's currently running, downloads the new container image
and restarts the application.

If the currently running container image that's tagged "prod" matches
the container image tagged "army", you can initiate a restart using
the following commands in the FDO server terminal window:

    REPOID=YOUR-FDO-SERVER-IP-ADDR-OR-NAME:5000/howsmysalute
    podman pull --all-tags $REPOID
    podman tag $REPOID:usmc $REPOID:prod
    podman push $REPOID:prod

where YOUR-FDO-SERVER-IP-ADDR-OR-NAME matches the DNS name or IP
address of your FDO server.

In the edge device console, you should see the How's My Salute
application restart within thirty seconds. The application should
display the requirements for a US Marine Corps salute rather than
a US Army salute.

# TODO
* initiate update to underlying rpm-ostree image as well
